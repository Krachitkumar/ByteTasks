# Housing Prices Prediction Report

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using multiple linear regression to accurately forecast housing prices. The dataset consists of 50,000 rows, including features like square feet area, bedrooms, bathrooms, neighborhood, year built, and price.

## Approach

### 1. Loading and Exploring the Dataset

The dataset was loaded using the Pandas library. Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the data. Descriptive statistics and visualizations, such as histograms and scatter plots, were used to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

#### Feature Selection
The features selected for the model were 'SquareFeet', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', and 'YearBuilt'. These features were chosen based on their relevance to housing prices.

#### Train-Validation-Test Split
The dataset was split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.

#### Feature Scaling
Feature scaling was applied using `StandardScaler` to standardize the features and improve the convergence of the linear regression model.

### 3. Model Construction

#### Linear Regression
A multiple linear regression model was constructed using the scikit-learn library. The model was trained on the scaled training set.

### 4. Model Evaluation

#### Validation Set
The model was evaluated on the validation set using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. The evaluation provided insights into the model's performance on unseen data.

#### Cross-Validation
Cross-validation with 5 folds was performed to get a more robust evaluation of the model. This helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to different subsets of the data.

### 5. Results

The results from the validation set and cross-validation were analyzed to assess the model's predictive performance. The MSE and R-squared values provided quantitative measures of the model's accuracy and goodness of fit.

## Findings

### 1. Validation Set Performance
The model demonstrated good performance on the validation set with a low Mean Squared Error and a high R-squared value, indicating a good fit to the data.

### 2. Cross-Validation Results
The cross-validation results confirmed the model's ability to generalize well across different data subsets. The consistent performance across folds supports the reliability of the model.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the multiple linear regression model, trained on relevant features and evaluated using validation and cross-validation, shows promise in accurately forecasting housing prices. Further analysis and fine-tuning of hyperparameters may be explored to optimize the model further.
